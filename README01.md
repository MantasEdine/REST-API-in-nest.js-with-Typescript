Title: REST API in Nest.js with TypeScript, Prisma, Postgres, Login/Sign Up, JWT, Passport, Custom Pipes, Guards, and Dockerization

Description:
This project is a RESTful API built with Nest.js, utilizing TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and various features of the Nest.js framework. The API provides endpoints for user authentication, including login and sign up functionality, and uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and Passport for secure authentication.

The project demonstrates the power of Nest.js by leveraging its built-in features such as pipes, guards, and custom pipes. These features enable request validation, data transformation, and authorization checks, ensuring the API's reliability and security.

The integration of Prisma as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool allows seamless communication with a PostgreSQL database. Prisma simplifies database operations by generating a type-safe Prisma Client, providing a convenient and efficient way to interact with the database.

To enhance portability and scalability, the project includes Dockerization of both the PostgreSQL database and the Nest.js application. Docker enables easy setup and deployment of the development environment, making it more convenient for development teams.

By exploring this project, you will gain valuable insights into building a robust REST API using Nest.js, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, and essential features like authentication, request validation, and data transformation. This project serves as a solid foundation for developing scalable and secure backend applications.
